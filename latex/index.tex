J\-A\-A\-S Tools used to aid diagnosing opaque issues

B\-U\-I\-L\-D\-I\-N\-G

This is a standard Auto\-Tools build, so\-:

1) autoreconf -\/vfi

2) make install (or \char`\"{}make check\char`\"{} to include that plus run the tests)

3) make rpm (if so inclined)

java/jaastool.\-jar is the proper built jar file; convjars is where \char`\"{}convenience jars\char`\"{} are built if you're less concerned with license purity and more concerned with\-:

1) your tests are bogus. Let me test exactly what you tested; or

2) I need it working like yesterday. Holy crap please help me. Gimme something to download immediately to make the pain stop.

We've all been there. In both cases. grab convjars/jaastool.\-jar, it's not sanitary, but it works.

U\-S\-A\-G\-E

The only portion right is the \doxyref{Jaas\-No\-File.\-java}{p.}{JaasNoFile_8java_source} which nearly works as eloquently as implied. I use it for trying to see why a Kerberos client who shall remain nameless (V\-W-\/3) is not getting a clear result from the Kerberos server and/or not logging the full story. Also, said client is a great product, but in cases of customer doubt or dialect/terminology skew, this utility is a third-\/party to that argument. \begin{DoxyVerb}java -jar jaastool.jar -E
\end{DoxyVerb}


For more detail\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}java -jar jaastool.jar -EDv
\end{DoxyVerb}


Jaas\-Tool will then grab your username and domain as Principal and Realm, hit your L\-O\-G\-O\-N\-S\-E\-R\-V\-E\-R, and report the details verbosely. There will be a summary after it's all done.

o You'll be asked multiple times for your password. Don't worry, to avoid storing it, Jaas\-Tool re-\/asks.

o There will be a lot of java exception and Kerberos stuff. Don't worry, just wait for the summary at the end

o S\-E\-R\-I\-O\-U\-S\-L\-Y, do the password thing repeatedly until the summary. Details are all through that text.

The Sumary will tell you which principal@realm works at which servers (O\-K, which username@domain)

The code is hereby pasted to allow inspection and improve trust. Kerberos is used in secure environments. I get that, so I'm \char`\"{}opening the trenchcoat to show nothing stashed inside\char`\"{}.

Now go, get what you need, fix your pain!

</para><para>JAAS Tools used to aid diagnosing opaque issues</para><para>BUILDING</para><para>This is a standard AutoTools build, so:</para><para>1) autoreconf -vfi</para><para>2) make install (or &quot;make check&quot; to include that plus run the tests)</para><para>3) make rpm (if so inclined)</para><para>java/jaastool.jar is the proper built jar file; convjars is where &quot;convenience jars&quot; are built if you&apos;re less concerned with license purity and more concerned with:</para><para>1) your tests are bogus. Let me test exactly what you tested; or</para><para>2) I need it working like yesterday. Holy crap please help me. Gimme something to download immediately to make the pain stop.</para><para>We&apos;ve all been there. In both cases. grab convjars/jaastool.jar, it&apos;s not sanitary, but it works.</para><para>USAGE</para><para>The only portion right is the <ref refid="JaasNoFile_8java_source" kindref="compound">JaasNoFile.java</ref> which nearly works as eloquently as implied. I use it for trying to see why a Kerberos client who shall remain nameless (VW-3) is not getting a clear result from the Kerberos server and/or not logging the full story. Also, said client is a great product, but in cases of customer doubt or dialect/terminology skew, this utility is a third-party to that argument. <verbatim>java -jar jaastool.jar -E
</verbatim></para><para>For more detail: <verbatim>java -jar jaastool.jar -EDv
</verbatim></para><para>JaasTool will then grab your username and domain as Principal and Realm, hit your LOGONSERVER, and report the details verbosely. There will be a summary after it&apos;s all done.</para><para>o You&apos;ll be asked multiple times for your password. Don&apos;t worry, to avoid storing it, JaasTool re-asks.</para><para>o There will be a lot of java exception and Kerberos stuff. Don&apos;t worry, just wait for the summary at the end</para><para>o SERIOUSLY, do the password thing repeatedly until the summary. Details are all through that text.</para><para>The Sumary will tell you which principal@realm works at which servers (OK, which username@domain)</para><para>The code is hereby pasted to allow inspection and improve trust. Kerberos is used in secure environments. I get that, so I&apos;m &quot;opening the trenchcoat to show nothing stashed inside&quot;.</para><para>Now go, get what you need, fix your pain! </para>    </detaileddescription>
